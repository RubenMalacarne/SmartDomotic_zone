# Smart Home Automation System

This repository contains the full stack of a modular smart home automation project. It allows the control of lights, power outlets, window shutters, and potentially more, using various communication interfaces and control frameworks.

## Features

- 🔌 Control lights and sockets
- 🪟 Automate window shutters
- 🤖 ROS 2 integration for modular robot-based control
- 🌐 Socket communication for network-based commands
- 📡 ESP-NOW support for low-latency wireless communication
- 🧩 Modular architecture to allow for easy expansion

## Technologies Used

- **ROS 2 (Humble)** for robotic middleware and message-passing
- **ESP32/ESP8266** devices for embedded control
- **ESP-NOW** for wireless device-to-device communication
- **Python/C++** for backend logic and control interfaces
- **MQTT / WebSocket / TCP Sockets** (optional modules)

## Repository Structure (planned)
